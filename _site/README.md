This is the [TCB]Blog: created following the guidance of the Learn Enough CSS and Layout to Be Dangerous tutorial.</br>
This website was designed in order to learn the intricacies of website design utilising CSS and is my first real attempt at website creation. It also made use of Jekyll, as this Blog uses purely static webpages.</br>
