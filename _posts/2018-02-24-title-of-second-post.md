***Where to start?*** This blog will represent the musings of a developing, developer: from zero experience to (hopefully) some level of competence.  
The main purposes of this blog were to:

<ul class="post-list">
  <li> <em>Learn how to create one from scratch in the first place.</em></li>
  <li> <em>Begin the process of establishing a professional web presence for myself.</em></li>  
  <li> <em>Create a destination which can act as an online portfolio of my work to date.</em></li>
</ul>

Follow me in my journey if you so choose, and should you wish to share your thoughts or advice if you have experience in the field, it would be most appreciated.


Best wishes,  
Tom
